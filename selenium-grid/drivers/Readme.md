## web drivers

In selenium 2 the drivers of all major browsers where included. Selenium 3 does not include the drivers of the major browsers anymore, 
so you  will need to download the drivers for Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft's Edge. In this directory we already included the drivers compatible with the browsers stored in the browsers directory.
