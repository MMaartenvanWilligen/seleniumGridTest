The following frameworks and libraries are used for setting up the test area.  

- NodejS

#### browser drivers

Selenium grid 3 doesnâ€™t include browser drivers anymore, so we have to install them remotely. The project includes two installation files installGeckodriver.sh and installChromedriver.sh. These sh files download and move the driver into the /usr/local/bin/ directory on your machine. 

``` command
$ sudo sh installGeckodriver.sh && sh installChromedriver.sh
```
The drivers should be on your systems path. Check if they are by executing the following command: 

``` command
$ printf "%s\n" $PATH
```
When they are not on the Path go to [Set path](#Set path)

#### start test
The start.sh file initilaize the selenium grid and executes the test. 

``` command
$ sudo sh start.sh
```
